## About The Project

This project analyzes a heart disease dataset to explore and understand patterns related to patient characteristics and predict the presence of heart disease. The goal is to visually present these insights using Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, along with various statistical analyses.

## About The Data

The dataset contains the following features:

- **age**: Age of the patient.
- **sex**: Gender (1 = male, 0 = female).
- **cp**: Chest pain type (4 values).
- **trestbps**: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg).
- **chol**: Serum cholesterol (in mg/dl).
- **fbs**: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true, 0 = false).
- **restecg**: Resting electrocardiographic results (0, 1, 2).
- **thalach**: Maximum heart rate achieved.
- **exang**: Exercise induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no).
- **oldpeak**: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.
- **slope**: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment.
- **ca**: Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (0-3).
- **thal**: Thalassemia (0 = normal, 1 = fixed defect, 2 = reversible defect).
- **target**: Presence of heart disease (1 = yes, 0 = no).

This dataset helps in understanding the relationships between various patient features and their likelihood of having heart disease.

## Technology Stack

This project uses the following technologies:

- **Python**: Programming language.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Matplotlib**: Plotting graphs and charts.


## Usage and Visualizations

This section contains an overview of the visualizations included in the project:

- **Target Class Distribution**: Visualize the distribution of heart disease vs. no disease.
- **Sex Distribution**: Analyze the frequency of male vs. female patients.
- **Chest Pain Type Distribution**: Explore different types of chest pain in the dataset.
- **Correlation Heatmap**: Understand the relationships between numerical features.
- **Other Feature Distributions**: Explore the distribution of features like age, cholesterol, and resting blood pressure.
